# Flight Price Prediction

This machine learning project predicts flight prices based on multiple travel-related features.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- Public flight fare dataset with features like airline, source, destination, duration, stops, and date/time.

## ðŸ”§ Techniques Used
- Feature extraction from date and time columns
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- Model training using Random Forest Regressor
- Model evaluation using MAE and RMSE
- Feature importance visualization

## ðŸ“ˆ Output
The model provides accurate predictions of flight fares and identifies key influencing features.

## ðŸ›  Tools
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
